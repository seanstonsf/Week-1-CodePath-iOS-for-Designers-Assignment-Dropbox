# Week-1-CodePath-iOS-for-Designers-Assignment-Dropbox

Time spent: 11 hours spent in total

I went through the assignment checking off all of the steps. 

Some Extras:
• Added an extra signed out screen to have modal segues manually pushing to the login and create screen when a button is pressed. This allowed me to create a more seamless loop of signing in & out. 
• Added reverse clicks to the welcome flow & connected all of the Sign In & Sign Up buttons with manual pushes. 
• An extra scrollview for the Photos screen of Sign In Existing Users.
